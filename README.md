# EasyEmail

## About

The objective of this program is to reduce the amount of time spent on typing long/repetitive pieces of text (like my incredibly long email I need to type regularly).

By pressing the combination **CTRL+SHIFT+1,** you will be able to auto type any text you want.

## Cloning the code

Clone the respository or dowbload it and place at a path of your preference.

## Set up

### .env file

At the same folder where the file called "easyemail.pyw" is, create a filed called ".env" (without quotes, make sure the extension is .env), and in there copy and paste the following:

    EMAIL=example@gmail.com

Replace the example email with your email/text.

### Auto start on boot

If you want to start "easyemail.pyw" every time on boot, do this:

 1. Right click the file called "easyemail.pyw", create a shortcut and copy/cut it.
 2. Press Windows Key + R (to open Run), type "%appdata%" and click "OK".
 3. Open folder Microsoft. Windows, Start Menu and Programs.
 4. Paste the shortcut there.
 5. You're ready to go, program will auto execute every time on boot.


### First launch

If you just downloaded the program and don't want to reboot the system in order to start using it, double click the file called "easyemail.pyw". You won't see any window, but it should start working.
